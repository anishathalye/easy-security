# So why I am here, and why should I care?

* People who might care about security

    * cryptonuts

    * journalists

    * activists

    * researchers in dangerous situations

    * anyone who has any reason for the police to not be fond of you

    * people who care about / are friends with those who actually need the security, in order to help provide covering traffic and normalize security culture

    * YOU!

traditionally, individuals who care about security include: cryptonuts, journalists, activists, researchers in dangerous situations...

anyone who has any reason the police might not be fond of you

we believe that it is important for everyone to be more aware about their security, and that they can be more secure with surprisingly low effort


If there's any chance you might need to be secure in the future, then it's important to start early; getting suddenly paranoid looks suspicious and attracts attention

If you care about any of the people who actually need the security, then you can help by providing covering traffic and normalizing security culture so that security-conscious users stand out less

# Defining Your Thread Model

* Understand your circumstances

    * Who's (possibly) after you?

    * What do they want?

    * What are their capabilities?


* Define your needs/values

    * confidentiality, privacy, anonymity, anti-surveillance

    * integrity, authenticity

    * availability


???

* talk about our own threat models

---

# Before we go on...

* Security can be overwhelming, and you cannot win

* Choose your battles by defining your threat model

* Even a little security is (most likely) better than no security, so it's okay if you don't do everything we talk about today, just do whatever you can

* Our recommendations are our own, based on our experiences, general knowledge, and understanding of the general student's threat model 

---

# Now for the 10 weird - aka relatively low effort - things!

* Passwords
* Internet browsing
* Hardware

---

# 1) Get a password manager

---

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

---

# 1) Password security: basics

* Password entropy

    * Password generation model

    * `# bits of entropy = log_2(# possibilities)`

    * Ex: 4 dictionary words: `log_2(150000^4) = 69 bits`


* Diceware

* Unique passwords


???

* How to compute password entropy?

    * Define password generation model

    * Assume adversary knows this scheme

    * a little over 150k words in the Oxford English Dictionary

* How much entropy do you need? 70 bits is good

    * Can calculate based on how many computers attacker has, how long your password needs to stay secure


---

# 1) Password managers

* Currently accepted a best practice in security community

* Remember a single strong master password, randomly generate the rest

* Browser plugins

    * Makes life easier for you, also helps prevent phishing attacks


---

# 1) Password managers: recommendations

* KeePassX

    * https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-keepassx


???

* free and open-source software
* recommended by EFF

---

# 2) Use 2-Factor Authentication

---


# 2) 2-Factor Authentication

* Something you know (password) + something you have (token)

* SMS, TOTP, U2F

* At least use 2FA for the services you really care about

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/YubiKey-4-keychain-and-YubiKey-4-Nano.png/320px-YubiKey-4-keychain-and-YubiKey-4-Nano.png)

???

* IS&T will give you a free YubiKey if you ask for it
* SMS 2FA isn't a really good idea these days - SMS system is pretty insecure

---

# 3) Don't use biometrics

---

# 3) Biometrics: don't use them

* Can't change things once biometrics are compromised

* Your fingerprint isn't protected by the Constitution

    * You're protected against revealing passwords under the Fifth Amendment (right against self-incrimination)


---

# Internet browsing

* Network connections
* Browsers
* Browser extensions
* Online applications
* Encrypted chat
* Anonymous browsing

---

# 4) Use a secure web browser

---

# 4) Browsers: recommendations

* Firefox is nice, open source, has lots of helpful security browser extensions


* Opera has a free VPN
* Chromium: open source version of Chrome
* No Internet Explorer, Edge


---

# 5) Use browser extensions that help enforce good security habits

---

# 5) Browser extensions

* uBlock Origin (Firefox, Chrome): blocks scripts serving advertisements; you can also use it to make a "malicious ad" blocklist

    * Not AdBlock Plus

    * **NOT uBlock**

* HTTPS Everywhere (Firefox): tries to use an encrypted connection whenever it can, verifies certificates of websites you visit
* NoScript (Firefox): blocks javascript, Flash, etc, except on pages you've explicitly decided to trust
* Privacy Badger (Firefox): detects and blocks ads/trackers

---

# 6) Use online applications that you trust

---

# 6) Other online applications, search engines

* DuckDuckGo.com: privacy-respecting search engine
* Framasoft.org: central homepage for many privacy-respecting webapps, such as Framadate.org (like WhenIsGood), Framapad.org (like Google Docs)


---

# 7) If you care, use anonymous browsing

---

# 7) Anonymous Browsing with Tor

* Tor is an anonymizing network that routes your traffic through a series of different volunteer-run servers, so no single eavesdropper can tell where it's really going
* https://www.torproject.org/

---

# 7) Anonymous Browsing with Tor

![](https://www.eff.org/files/tor-https-3.png)

---

# 7) Anonymous Browsing with Tor

* The easiest way to use Tor is with the Tor Browser, a modified version of Firefox with Tor built in
* https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
* The Tor Browser also includes NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere
* There's a simple slider to configure how secure vs. usable you want the Tor Browser to be
   * Click on the onion logo, and select "Privacy and Security Settings"

---

# 8) Use end-to-end encrypted communication

---


# 8) Encrypted communication

* The Ideal: End to End Encryption

    * only the 2 people communicating (at the "ends") can read the messages

    * Intermediate servers can't read anything


---

# 8) Encrypted communication: recommendations

* Signal
   * App for iOS and Android phones, super-easy to set up and use
   * On Android, can set it as default SMS app

---

# 9) Backup early, often, and to completion - especially your security stuff, etc.

---

# 9) Backups

* Make them (encrypted!). Regularly.

* Backups are good for you in general.
* In case your laptop dies / is stolen

* Specifically for purposes regarding security, 
back up your gpg (~/.gnupg), ssh keys (~/.ssh), password manager files (e.g. your `*.kdbx` file for KeePassX)

---

# 9) Backups: recommended steps

* Get an external harddrive
* Backup using

    * Mac OS: Time Machine (check the box for encrypted backups)

    * Ubuntu:

    * Windows:



How: use ??? to make encrypted backups

---

# 10) Secure your hardware

---

# 10) Hardware tracking

* Before you lose your phone/laptop/etc., install a device tracking application

* Mac OS / iOS: Find My iPhone
* Android:

* Device tracking + remote wipe

* 

---

# 10) Full Disk Encryption

* Do it so that if someone gets physical access to your machine, they can't also read your files
* Your data rights are not protected across borders (???)

* Ubuntu
* Mac - enable FileVault
* Windows
