# Overview

TODO

---


# Defining Your Thread Model

---

# Before we go on...

* Security can be overwhelming, and you cannot win
* Choose your battles by defining your threat model
* Even a little security is (most likely) better than no security, so it's okay if you don't do everything we talk about today, just do whatever you can
* Our recommendations are our own, based on our experiences, general knowledge, and understanding of the general student's threat model 

---

# Password security

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

---

# Password security: basics

* Password entropy
* Password generation model
* `# bits of entropy = log_2(# possibilities)`
* Ex: 4 dictionary words: `log_2(150000^4) = 69 bits`

* Diceware

* Unique passwords

???

* How to compute password entropy?
* Define password generation model
* Assume adversary knows this scheme
* a little over 150k words in the Oxford English Dictionary

---

# Password managers

* Currently accepted a best practice in security community

* Remember a single strong master password, randomly generate the rest

* Browser plugins
* Makes life easier for you, also helps prevent phishing attacks

---

# Password managers: recommendations

* https://www.lastpass.com/

TODO - do we want to recommend more than one? 

---

# 2-Factor Authentication

* Something you know (password) + something you have (token)

* SMS, TOTP, U2F

* At least use 2FA for the services you really care about

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/YubiKey-4-keychain-and-YubiKey-4-Nano.png)

???

* IS&T will give you a free YubiKey if you ask for it
* SMS 2FA isn't a really good idea these days - SMS system is pretty insecure

---

# Biometrics: don't use them

* Can't change things once biometrics are compromised

* Your fingerprint isn't protected by the Constitution
* You're protected against revealing passwords under the Fifth Amendment (right against self-incriminatino)

---

# Internet browsing

* Network connections
* Browsers
* Browser extensions


---

# Network connections

* Secure vs unsecure network
* Unsecure network traffic from your device to the access point is unencrypted
* If you can, always connect to secure networks

* End to End Encryption
*

---

# Browsers: recommendationas

* No Internet Explorer, Edge

* Firefox is nice, open source, has lots of helpful security browser extensions

* Opera has a free VPN
* Chromium: open source version of Chrome

---

# Browser extensions

* AdBlock Plus (Firefox, Chrome): blocks scripts serving advertisements; you can also use it to make a "malicious ad" blocklist
* HTTPS Everywhere (Firefox): tries to use an encrypted connection whenever it can, verifies certificates of websites you visit
* NoScript (Firefox), NotScripts (Chrome): blocks javascript, Flash, etc.
* Privacy Badger (Firefox): detects and blocks ads/trackers

---

# Hardware tracking

* Before you lose your phone/laptop/etc., install a device tracking application

* Mac OS / iOS: Find My iPhone
* Android:

*
Device tracking + remote wipe

* 

---

# Backups

* Make them (encrypted!). Regularly.

* Backups are good for you in general.
* In case your laptop dies / is stolen

* Specifically for purposes regarding security, 
back up your gpg (~/.gnupg), ssh keys (~/.ssh), password manager files, etc.

---

# Backups: recommended steps

* Get an external harddrive
* Backup using
* Mac OS: Time Machine
* Ubuntu:
* Windows

rd

How: use ??? to make encrypted backups


---

# Full Disk Encryption

* Do it so that if someone gets physical access to your machine, they can't also read your files
* Your data rights are not protected across borders (???)

* Ubuntu
* Mac
* Windows
